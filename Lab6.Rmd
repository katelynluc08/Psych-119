```{r}



#1. Read in your csv data file using read.csv
setwd('C:/Users/kate/Downloads')
dual_table <- read.csv('lab6data.csv')

#2. Make sure it is formatted correctly, and convert to long format using pivot_longer. Then use Use group_by() and summarize() to aggregate all the trials/blocks that belong to a participant, and yeild have one value per participant and IV.

dual_table.long <- dual_table |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Condition"),
    names_to = "Condition type",
    values_to = "Scores"
  )

dual_table.long

# No multiple trials so I do not have to use group_by or summarize. 



```

```{r}

#3. Create a new column in your data frame in which you compute within-participant contrast (subtraction) between your two conditions of interest. Call this column condition_contrast. Then, report and means and SDs of each of your IVs, reflecting between-participant variance.

dual_table.new <- dual_table.long |>
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = Subject, 
    names_from = `Condition type`,
    values_from = Scores
  ) |>
  mutate(condition_contrast = Condition1 - Condition2)

dual_table.new

dual_table.summary <- dual_table.new |>
  summarize(mean_condition1 = mean(Condition1, na.rm = TRUE), mean_condition2 = mean(Condition2, na.rm = TRUE), sd_1 = sd(Condition1, na.rm = TRUE), sd_2 = sd(Condition2, na.rm = TRUE)
            )

dual_table.summary 


```


```{r}

#4. Use t-test() to compare condition_contrast to your null hypothesis with the t distribution. 

# Comparing average condition contrast to see if it is equal to 0 or not because then you can conclude that there may or may not be a significant difference and you do this by using t-test()"

data_results <- t.test(dual_table.new$condition_contrast, mu = 0)
